Death and Freedom

I don’t understand why one should be afraid of death? Isn’t it the
freedom one always wanted!?

Is it that he still has a very tiny hope that things will get better? Is
it that he still has people who love him? Is it that he doesn’t want to
make his people sad?

IS IT WORTH THE COST OF FREEDOM!?!

Is the weight of living worth more than the freedom of death?

If yes, then my friend, have no regrets when you are about to get that
“freedom”.
