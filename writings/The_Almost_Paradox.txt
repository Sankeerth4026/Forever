The Almost Paradox

Is it really almost, or did they just make it feel like almost for their
benefit? Was I fooled, or was I just undeserving? Is it me, or is it
just the way things are?

Seriously, I am done being this almost thing. Again and again and again,
I feel sooooooooo stupid — a worthless piece of compulsion enslaved by
this feeling of wanting to be loved.

Kill it. Fuckin kill that feeling. You are happy alone and always will
be happy alone. Trust me, you will.
