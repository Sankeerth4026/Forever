I Feel Loved!

I feel loved and I love too, yet still my heart overwhelmingly has a lot
more of it.

You once asked how I am able to show so much love. People usually can’t,
even if they carry loads of love within them.

Now to answer that question, let’s see — how do I know I love you?

My smile, My uncontrollable bright smile that appears when someone
teases me with your name. It told me that I love you.

My eyes, Which aren’t the best, but when they see you — they shine
brighter than stars and galaxies ever could. They told me that I love
you.

My heart, The way my heart melts when you act cute, just like a baby
trying to get what she wants. It told me that I love you.

My brain… my hormones, The way they change my entire mood when I see you
— telling me to bite you, adore you, kiss you, pamper you. Ahhhhh… a lot
of things. They told me I definitely love you.

And last, but not at all the least — The zoo, The butterflies that dance
in my stomach when you call my name veryyyyy cutely like “nannaluuuu” 😘
They declared that I love you veryyy, veryyy much.

How much? Very, veryyy much. And how much is that? Well… too much for my
heart to handle. That’s the reason I show it all to my cutie, my
sweetie, my all-time solace, my happiest coincidence, my beloved
bangaaaaram, my wifey 🫠
