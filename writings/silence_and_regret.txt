Silence and Regret

Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you don’t quite know how
to feel? Should I be happy, mad, sad…? What should I do? I honestly
don’t know.

So, I stay silent.

But then again—how can I remain silent, knowing that my reaction could
change the outcome of the situation? And how long can I stay this way?
Eventually, someone—or maybe even my own inner voice—will ask, “So, what
exactly do you feel?”

What will I say then?

Will I have a clear answer? Will the time I’m so dependent on give me
the clarity I need?

Or will I just end up regretful that I stayed quiet, knowing my reaction
mattered and could’ve made a difference?

What’s really stopping me? Why can’t I take a decision?

Is it fear—fear of being wrong? Or is it the belief that I’m just not
ready for whatever the outcome might be?

For now, I hide behind time, hoping it will guide me towards something
better.
