Single Life and Peace

Single life is the best. No expectations, no disappointments. It’s
usually very, very peaceful this way — unless you are too lonely.

When we have a person to share our thoughts and problems with, without
the fear of being judged, then what’s the need of a girlfriend or
anything? We are at peace and comfort.

But then suddenly, we witness a person we never thought we wanted — and
suddenly, we need them.

We sacrifice the peace to spend the rest of our lives with that person.
Just the thought of them being by your side brings you peace. And that,
my friend, is what I consider true peace.

So, peaceful single life? Yes — great, very nice. But when you witness a
person like the one above, do step out of it.

Because no matter how peaceful your single life is, it may not last
forever. Loneliness creeps in, disturbing the peace, making you anxious.
Then suddenly, you feel unloved.

But when you have a person who brings you peace and promises to stay by
your side for the rest of your life, you get that sense of trust — the
feeling that you are not alone in this whole thing.

That’s the reason they are called the better half of your life.
