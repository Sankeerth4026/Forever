What the fuck did they say? “Promises are meant to be broken.” That’s
one of the stupidest things I have heard in my life.

Instead, just say: “Early promises lead to late realisations.” Now this
is something I would accept — but the above one? Never in a million
years.

What I mean is, we often judge people too quickly without knowing them
fully and give them our commitment — the promise of being their trusted
asset.

But with time we realise they are not the person we imagined they were,
hence weakening or even leaving the promise behind.

Now, oh captain my captain — whose fault is it?
Is it their fault for not being according to the expectations set by me?
Is it their fault for not acting like I imagined they would?

It’s our fault — judging too quickly, promising without acknowledging
the consequences.

Early promises don’t just lead to late realisations, they also weaken
the value of your trust and commitment.

So before you promise something, realise the consequence of breaking it.
If it still feels worth it, then it really is worth it.

“Before you promise in light, realise yourself in the shadow of time
first.”

“Even the vast ocean looks beautiful on a calm day, but only a storm can
show the terror it’s capable of.”
