Those Eyes

Drowned in those eyes — An Ocean! The shine, the sparkle — So
intoxicating, I forgot the risk of its depth.

By the time I realised the depth — I was too drowned to come out. By the
time I reached the dark — Pain became my warmth, Intoxication reached my
heart, And my mind? What do I even call it?! When it made chaos my
solace!!

How painful was it? When death became your well-wisher — The only thing
saving you from this misery!!

The thing even more miserable is — When death finally came, My only
regret was that I couldn’t drown more.

What’s even worse is — Even in my last breath, Deep in my heart, I knew
— Even after all this pain and suffering, If there was an afterlife or a
next life, I would still fall for — “Those eyes”
