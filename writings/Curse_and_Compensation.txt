Curse and Compensation

I always used to think, “Why me?! Why was I cursed by fate?” Until I
discovered chess.

Yes, you heard it right — chess. So, in chess when you are down a piece,
you have a losing position. Yeah, true. But if you have compensation for
the lost piece, then it’s a completely different story…

Then the way you play the game decides the outcome.

And now, if you can’t really find a compensation, then yes — you are in
a losing position, but not lost!! Create a compensation. Make it
difficult for your opponent to win. But NEVER EVER GIVE UP.

And yeah, for the dumb ones — I am not just talking about chess here.
Remember what I said in the first line? Now read it again…

To My past self and all those who think, “Why me?”

“Cursed by fate, compensated by life.”
