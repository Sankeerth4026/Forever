Jealousy is not at all bad, but is it a good thing?! Well, not exactly.

See, jealousy is a natural response to the fear of losing love, so it’s
not exactly a bad thing. The way you handle it decides whether it is
good or bad.

It has the capacity to strengthen any kind of relationship, but at the
same time, it can completely ruin everything too. That’s the reason why
I fear this thing—not because I’ll get jealous or anything. I fear being
on the other side, the one due to whom the jealousy started.
