Love, Hatred and Guilt

Love, Hatred and guilt — three completely different emotions, but the
way they are interlinked—ahhhhh!! I really hate it, but it is the
reality.

You loved someone you shouldn’t have. When the world tried to stop you,
you saw it as something holding you back. And when the dust settled and
you looked back— you saw yourself, and all that came to mind was guilt.

Also, the thing about love is that you never really know if what you are
doing is right, or if it’s all going to become your worst nightmare.

That’s the reason they say—you need guts to love someone.

And I personally see love as a war, a war between you and the world.
Neither side is right until the end.

If you win, the world kneels before your efforts and calls you a
warrior. If the world wins, the world may gain nothing—but you? You lose
faith in yourself.

Now you may say, “Well then I shall fight till I win! Even if it means
hurting myself!”

Well, that’s brave of you. But if the one for whom you started the war
turns their back against you, all that’s left in you is a heavy heart, a
mind filled with hatred, and a hope that the world will understand this…
and go easy on you.

All of these were beautifully explained in one of my favourite movies,
“MAHANATI”

🎶 “Gelupuleni Samaram jaruputhondi Samayam, Mungimchedelaa Ee Ranam” 🎶

🎶 “Aakasam Taake Aasa Teerindhaa… Teerani Daaham Aagindhaa… Jarige
Mathanam lo Vishamedho Rasamedho Teleyna Eppudaina Yennalaina…” 🎶

🎵 “Naranaraalalona Vishamayindhi Prema, Chivaraku Migiledhi, idhe
Ayithe Vidhi Raatha Tappincha Tharamaa…” 🎶

And I am telling this with a heavy heart—

“If you ever felt love, you must also accept the risk of feeling hatred.
Cause when things take a wrong turn, the only person left to blame is
yourself.”

“Every light has its own shadow, Every memory has its own sorrow. So
when your heart grows heavy and things become shallow, May the world
listen to your heartache, Wrapping you with a glowing halo…”
