Perfection means something that has no flaws? Well, not exactly! And
does perfection mean that it’s loved and accepted by everyone?! No, a
big no.

A fish is perfect for the sea, at the same time unfit for land. So, it
doesn’t solely depend on the person itself; it also depends on the
perspective on which perfection is being measured.

The more compatible the person is with the perspective, the more perfect
he looks. And this perfection need not mean all good. Being perfect has
flaws in itself…

A calm, well-mannered individual will be a boring person. A fun, playful
individual will be a person who takes everything as a joke. An
intellectual and studious individual will be a tough one to understand.

Hence similarly, A perfect individual — a mixture of everything — will
also have flaws based on the perspective you see. An individual’s
perfection changes depending on compatibility.

Perfection is more like a puzzle piece; it fits right when it finds its
holder. Until then, it remains the same ordinary piece, unfit with
everything and everyone.
