Many writers— independent of language, place, region and tradition—have
said the same cruel words about love.

Many Urdu shayers told: “Pyaar sahab aisi berehem cheez hai naa. Kya
bataun main? Aap khud sunlo— Naseeb naseeb ki baat hai pyaar. Koi nafrat
karke bhi pyaar paata hai, toh koi, behpanah mohabbat karke bhi akele
reh jaata hai.”

Many Russian writers said: “The thing that I absolutely hate about love
is that people who get it never really understand the value of it.
People who know the value of it will never really get it.”

Well, my younger self also said something when I was 17:

“We all know not everyone deserves love. But again, why do I notice
people with the purest intentions are crumbled like nothing, and
lunatics are getting all the care and attention? Who really is the
undeserving? Is there something I can’t see, or is this how things are
meant to be? Why are people the way they are? Is there no way for this
to change? Or is everything fine and I am just not seeing things
clearly? And with all my heart, I hope it’s the last question— that I
just didn’t see things clearly.”

And now my present self:

Every time I start to believe that people are changing, someone
somewhere proves me wrong. Is it because people think this is what they
deserve? Or are they so obsessed with the concept of love rather than
the person they are in love with, that they completely manipulate
themselves into thinking love is hurting, and thus them hurting is what
gives them love?

I never truly understood this.

For now, I believe this is how human nature is. Complete madness. The
brain which can take you to Mars can’t solve this simple human mindset
error.

Ahhhhhhh… error 404. Bye-bye, that’s more than enough for today.
