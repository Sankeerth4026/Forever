I want to tell the world

You weren’t just the light which held my hand when I was in darkness.
Instead, You were that ray of warmth and hope which guided me towards
the light when I foolishly made darkness my only solace.

That’s the reason I made you my solace.

So thank you, for showing me not just what light feels like, but also
what true solace looks like.
